# Anomaly-detection-baseline

This repository contains a baseline for anomaly detection.

Additionally, you can find public datasets for anomaly detection in the `AnormalyDetectionDatasets/PublicDatasets_TSAD.md` folder. 
We will continue to update these datasets and upload them in zip format to the `AnormalyDetectionDatasets` folder.
If you have any other datasets, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
